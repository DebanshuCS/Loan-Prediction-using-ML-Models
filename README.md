- During the online application process, the company seeks to automate (in real time) the loan qualification process based on the information entered by the customer. ML models will help the company predict loan approvals, thereby speeding up the decision-making process for determining whether or not an applicant is eligible for a loan.

### Objectives of Notebook 📌

- This notebook aims to:

Using the EDA data set, analyze customer data provided by the customer

Develop ML models that predict loan approvals.

### 👨‍💻 The machine learning models used in this project are:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

### Data Set Description 🧾
 #### There are 13 variables in this data set:

8 categorical variables,

4 continuous variables, and

1 variable to accommodate the loan ID.


### 👉 The following is the structure of the data set :
